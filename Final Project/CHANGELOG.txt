--- Goals Met So Far ---
* "Physics" for ball work decently, have to fine tune them.
* Player is able to kick the ball in any direction they want, with whatever velocities they want.
* Able to tell when ball hits the ground, and stops all velocities.
* Able to tell when ball hits net (any side), and stops all velocities.
* Imported objects created in Blender light up with their normals well, and cast shadows well.
* Ball is not a simple sphere - It has over 40,000 vertices, to simulate the patches and stitching (So you can zoom very close to it and see the detail).
* Goal and Net have been modeled and look good.
* Skybox is added for prettiness.



--- Things to do ---
* Make ball color/texture change on button press (easy).
* Make lighting look prettier (less harsh).
* Fix/fine tune physics of the ball.
* Fine Tune physics for stopping ball in net and out of net (letting the ball go beyond the net in the X and Z directions).
* Create 3D model of the stadium.
* Create 3D model of water bottles? (Might add this for fun)
* Fix Skybox (only using one texture right now)
* Add materials to models. They have some in Blender, I just need to port them over.



--- Things I might not be able to add from proposal ---
* Particles.
* Grass blades (in the density I wanted them) made Blender/openGL lag on my VM, so I just won't add them.
